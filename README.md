# Covid-19-data-analysis
In the dataset there are 455 Rows and 11 Columns.
The features that we have considered are symptoms and age.
As we have taken X as a independent variable i.e symptoms like cough, 
fever, sore throat, difficulty in breathing, pains, diarrhea .
Now the dependent variable is Y which is a predictive variable as well.
So, the final corona  result will be taken or considered 
in Y i.e. whether the patient in question has covid or not.
